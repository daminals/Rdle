# Rdle

I made this program for a number of reasons. First off, I have been extremely into wordle for the past 3 weeks (still haven't lost yet) and I thought it would be a fairly simple project to create

Second off, I wanted more practice and experience in Rust. Although I have been using it for a number of projects recently, I find the langauge really interesting and am very interested in developing new projects with it.

## How to play wordle

The rules for wordle are as follows:
- You must guess a 5 letter word the program has chosen
- You have 6 guesses.
- If a letter is in a solution and the guess you made, the letter will be highlighted yellow
- If a letter is in a solution and the guess you made, in the order you guessed it, the letter will be highlighted green

## What I learned

I learned about reading through text files, parsing and unwrapping, error handling, and while loops (although I replaced them with recursion) in Rust.
